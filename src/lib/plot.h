/* Raster pixel plot on the ZX ULA screen.
 *
 * plot(x, y) sets a single pixel at (x, y). Origin is top-left,
 * x in 0..255, y in 0..191 (clipped silently if y >= 192).
 *
 * ZXN: writes the ULA framebuffer at $4000-$57FF directly using the
 * Z80N PIXELAD/SETAE instructions. No ROM dependency.
 *
 * Host: maintains a 256x192 shadow bitmap and renders it through
 * termbox2 using 2x2 quadrant block glyphs when the capability is
 * enabled. Falls back to a plain-text log line otherwise so the
 * test harness keeps working.
 *
 * Plotting is additive — the existing framebuffer byte is OR'd with
 * the pixel bit. No unplot, toggle, or XOR variants in Phase 1.
 */

/* Draw mode — controls how plot/draw/circle/fill merge new pixels
 * with the existing framebuffer. Sticky global state; reads current
 * mode at each pixel write. Default additive (0).
 *
 *   0: new = old | mask  — additive (OR, default)
 *   1: new = old ^ mask  — toggle  (XOR; draw twice to erase)
 *
 * The user-facing setter is over(byte) in ink_paper.h — it matches
 * Spectrum BASIC's OVER 0/1 and drives both this pixel-level merge
 * mode and the ROM text-channel OVER state in one call.
 *
 * Internal — read by draw.c / plot.c inline asm via absolute LD A,(nn).
