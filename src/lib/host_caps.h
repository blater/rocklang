/* Rock RTL capability flags.
 *
 * Every RTL component that has different fidelity between the real target
 * (ZXN) and the host development build (gcc) exposes a capability flag
 * here. Components read the flags; they never initialise themselves.
 *
 * `rock_rtl_init()` is called exactly once at program startup by the
 * generator-emitted `main()` wrapper (see generator.c `transpile_fundef`),
 * right after `fill_cmd_args`. It is the single place where host terminals
 * are opened, capability probes run, and atexit hooks installed.
 *
 * On ZXN the init is trivial: every capability is set to 1.
 * On the host target the init does real work (isatty check, tb_init, etc.).
 *
 * Components are forbidden from calling `tb_init`, `atexit`, or any other
 * lifecycle primitive directly — those responsibilities live here.
